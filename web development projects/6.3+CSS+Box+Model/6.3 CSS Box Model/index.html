  <div id="firstdiv">
    <p>Despite facing occasional setbacks and moments of self-doubt, Sihle pressed on. He knew that his lack of formal qualifications didn't define his worth as a developer. With each line of code he wrote and every project he completed, Sihle grew more confident in his abilities.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="seconddiv">
    <p>As the years went by, Sihle's reputation as a talented web developer continued to soar. His portfolio blossomed with a diverse array of projects, showcasing his creativity and expertise. And when the time finally came to pursue his dreams professionally, Sihle found that doors once closed to him were now swinging wide open.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="thirddiv">
    <p>With a blend of passion, perseverance, and a sprinkle of rural charm, Sihle proved that you don't need a fancy degree to succeed in the world of web development. For him, the only qualification that truly mattered was the unwavering belief in himself and his abilities. And as he looked out over the rolling hills of his hometown, Sihle knew that the sky was the limit for what he could achieve.</p>

  <!-- TODOs:
1. Create 3 Boxes using the div element.
2. Set their sizes to 200px height by 200px wide.
3. Set different background colors for each of the boxes (I used cadetblue, gold and indianred).
4. Add a paragraph <p> element into the first div and add the following words:
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam at sapien porttitor urna elementum lacinia. In
    id magna pulvinar, ultricies lorem id, vehicula elit. Aliquam eu luctus nisl, vitae pellentesque magna. Phasellus
    dolor metus, laoreet ac convallis sit amet, efficitur sed dolor.
5. Set the 1st div to have 20px padding all around with a black 10px border.
6. Fix the style of the <p> element to remove all margins.
Hint: Use the CSS inspector in Chrome.
7. Set the 2nd div to have a 20px border on top and bottom and 10px border left and right. (See goal image)
8. Set the 3rd div to have a 10px border 
9. Set the margins for the divs so that each box corner touches the other. (See the goal image)
